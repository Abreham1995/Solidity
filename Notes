Unsigned Integers
What the heck is an unsigned integer? 

First, let's go over integers. Integers include all positive and negative numbers without fractions. The numbers -2,-1,0,1,2 are all 
integers. This range continues in both the positive and negative direction as far as you can count!
To determine if the number is above or below zero we use the sign: + or -. An unsigned integer is an integer that has no sign. 
Solidity has a specific data type for unsigned integers called uint. A uint can be suffixed with the number of bits reserved for it.
For instance uint8 means that there are eight bits provided for the value of the variable.
What is the range of unsigned integers in eight bits? Eight bits can range from 00000000 to 11111111. This range can represent 256 unique values.
Since the range of unsigned integer values does not include negative numbers, it is simply 0 to 255. In decimal, the unsigned value of
00000000 is 0 and the value of 11111111 is 255. So, the max value a uint8 can store is 255. You can calculate the max value of a uint by 
doing (2 ^ n) - 1, where n is the number of bits it can use to store the value.
